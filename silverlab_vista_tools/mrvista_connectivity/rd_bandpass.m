%
% Bandpass filters a timeseries x with sampling frequency fs to the
% frequency band given by the 2-element vector freqrange. n is the filter 
% order (default 50); note x must be 3x as long as n. Uses the FIR
% method and filtfilt to achieve zero-phase lag filtering.

% freqrange = [.009 .08];
% fs = 0.5;

if nargin < 4
    n = 50;
